Dr. Mehta's expertise is in creating algorithms to solve challenging problems. This experience began in 2005 at the $30 billion hedge fund firm Citadel, where he eventually served as Head of Quantitative Strategies for Citadel Europe. He has spent over a decade writing algorithms which use a variety of mathematical and machine learning techniques to forecast future price movements, respond to competitors, identify inconsistencies, and trade across a variety of asset classes globally in financial markets and has also developed complex models and algorithms for other industries and mobile apps. He has a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago and completed his postdoctoral fellowship at the Max-Planck Institute in Germany.
