Dr. Mehta's expertise is in creating algorithms to solve challenging problems. He has spent over a decade doing this globally in financial markets, writing algorithms which use a variety of mathematical and machine learning techniques to forecast future price movements, respond to competitors, identify inconsistencies, and trade across a variety of asset classes. This experience began in 2005 at the $30 billion hedge fund firm Citadel, where he rose to become Head of Quantitative Strategies for Citadel Europe. He has also developed complex models and algorithms for other industries and mobile apps. He has a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago and completed his postdoctoral fellowship at the Max-Planck Institute in Germany.
