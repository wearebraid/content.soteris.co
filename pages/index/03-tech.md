# The Technology

Our first learning system understands the complex combinations of factors that drive your insurance risk - at a level of granularity beyond which humans can see - then uses what it has learned from your existing submission and loss data to score both current policies and future submissions to help you triage and price them.

In our pilot with our first customer, we fed our system a set of actual insurance policy and claim data to learn off of, then asked it to 'score' a separate set of policies it had never seen before. Each policy's score represents the system's estimate of the loss costs (incorporating both frequency and severity) of that previously-unseen policy. To test its predictive accuracy, we then sorted those policies top-to-bottom based solely on the assigned scores and split those policies into ten equal-sized buckets, best scores to worst, and then calculated the actual, eventual loss ratio for each bucket. The graph below displays the result -- the Soteris scoring system demonstrates a clear ability to predict which policies are likely to end up as loss-leaders, and which ones are not.

## Our software has demonstrated the ability to raise our customers' profitability **over 60%**.
